    <li>
    <b>Related Work:</b> What reading will you examine to provide context and background?
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Evaluation Plan:</b> How will you evaluate your results? Qualitatively, what kind of results do you expect (e.g. plots or figures)? Quantitatively, what kind of analysis will you use to evaluate and/or compare your results (e.g. what performance metrics or statistical tests)?
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

  <strong>Submission</strong>: Please upload one proposal per team on Gradescope. Unless you have written a petition proposal to us (and we have accepted it) you are only allowed to have two people per team.

    <li>A computer virus.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <a name="poster"></a><h2>Poster Session</h2>
  We will hold a poster session in which you will present the results of your projects is form of a poster. The poster session will happen on June 3rd, 2:00-5:00pm, at AT&amp;T patio (the lawn behind Gates building). Poster boards and easels will be provided.

  <h2>Example Project Reports</h2>
  Your project reports should structure like a NLP conference paper (NIPS, ICML, EMNLP, ACL, etc.). You can find publications from Stanford NLP Group from <a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/publications.shtml">here</a>. In addition, you may also take a look at some previous projects from other Stanford CS classes, such as <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs221/sample-projects/">CS221</a>, <a href="http://cs229.stanford.edu/projects2013.html">CS229</a>, <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/projects.html">CS224W</a> and <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/projects.html">CS231n</a>

  <h2>Collaboration Policy</h2>
  You can work in teams of up to <strong>2</strong> people.

  <h2>Honor Code</h2>
  You may consult any papers, books, online references, or publicly available implementations for ideas and code that you may want to incorporate into your strategy or algorithm, so long as you clearly cite your sources in your code and your writeup. However, under no circumstances may you look at another group’s code or incorporate their code into your project.
  
  <br><br>
  If you are doing a similar project for another class, you must make this clear and write down the exact portion of the project that is being counted for CS224d.
